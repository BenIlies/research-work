This repository contains final reports for machine learning related projects:
- The first one discusses about explainable AI in computer vision. Some algorithms were implemented from scratch and many interesting references are provided. Unfortunately, the implementation is still in a private repository for the moment.
- The second describes how adversarial attacks can be performed in self-driving cars. That is to say how we can add a perturbation able to modify the trajectory of a steering angle without the driver noticing.
